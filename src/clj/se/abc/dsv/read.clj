;; This function is implemented as a finite state machine. There are four states
;; (:escaped, :relation, :tuple, :quotation), and five signals (character, carriage
;; return, delimiter, end-of-file, end-of-line and quote). Every combination of 
;; state and signal maps to an action and a new state, unless the transition
;; leads to a final state or the signal is not allowed in the state context.
