# DSV

Create and parse CSV in Clojure.

## Installation

- `git clone git://github.com/deriksson/dsv.git`   
- `cd dsv`  
- `ant`

## Creating CSV

The function for creating CSV is in the namespace "se.abc.dsv.write".
Make it available to your program like this:

`(use 'se.abc.dsv.write)`

At its simplest, you create CSV by passing a dataset in the form of a
vector of vectors of strings to the function "write-csv":

`(write-csv [["apple" "fruit"]["monkey" "animal"]])`

Customise the CSV by specifying field delimiter and quote character.
In this example semicolons are used instead of commas as
field delimiters:

`(write-csv [["apple" "fruit"]["monkey" "animal"]] \;)`

In the following example single quotes are used instead of the default
double quotes to avoid delimiter collision:

`(write-csv [["apple, red" "fruit"]["apple, green" "fruit"]] \, \')`

## Parsing CSV

The namespace for the CSV parser is "se.abc.dsv.read":

`(use 'se.abc.dsv.read)`

The following simple example uses the default settings, and will create
a vector containing two vectors, each containing two strings.

`(read-csv "apple,fruit\nmonkey,animal")`

Use duck-streams to read a CSV file like this:

`(use 'clojure.contrib.duck-streams)
(read-csv (slurp* "/tmp/stats.csv"))`

The parser will raise an error if the CSV is not well-formed. Use 
error-kit from clojure contrib to handle errors:

`(use 'clojure.contrib.error-kit)`  
`(with-handler`  
` (read-csv (slurp* "/tmp/stats.csv"))`  
` (handle malformed-csv [msg] (println "Malformed CSV.")))`

The CSV function can be customised to handle other field delimiters
and quote characters than the defaults (',' and '"'):

`(read-csv "apple;fruit\nmonkey;animal" \;)`

`(read-csv "'apple, red',fruit" \, \')`
